# QR1.tech — Clean Top Nav (no second row)

- Removed **Builder** from top menu to stop wrap and confusion.
- Forced a **single-row** nav; it scrolls horizontally on small screens.
- Selector dots unchanged (still include Builder step).
- Flow: Home → Create (Templates) → Name → Builder; Analytics & Pricing also in nav.
